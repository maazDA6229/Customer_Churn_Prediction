## Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom Industry)  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The project involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to identify at-risk customers and provide actionable insights for reducing churn rates. 
 Project Overview  

Customer churn poses a significant challenge for telecom companies, impacting revenue and growth. This project uses machine learning models to predict churn based on customer demographics, behavior, and service usage patterns.  

 Objectives:  
- Analyze key drivers of customer churn.  
- Build predictive models to identify customers likely to churn.  
- Provide actionable insights for retention strategies. 

 Features  

The notebook includes the following:  
- Data Analysis: Exploratory analysis of customer demographics, service usage, and behavior.  
- Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.  
- Model Building: Training and evaluating various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to explore data trends.  
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.  

 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer-churn-prediction.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd customer-churn-prediction  
   ```  

3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook "Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom industry).ipynb"  
   ```  

 Usage  

1. Load the dataset (ensure the file path is correctly set in the notebook).  
2. Run the notebook step by step to:  
   - Understand the dataset.  
   - Preprocess data and train models.  
   - Evaluate and visualize results.  

3. The notebook supports customization for experimenting with different models and parameters.  

 Results  

 Key Findings:  
- High churn rates among customers with short tenure and overdue payments.  
- Bundled services and contract-based plans reduce churn likelihood.  

 Best Performing Model:  
- Example: Random Forest with an ROC-AUC of 0.92.  

Visualizations and additional insights can be found directly in the notebook.
